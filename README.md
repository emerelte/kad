# KAD

KAD stands for Kubernetes Anomaly Detector.

KAD is a system that uses Machine Learning to perform Anomaly Detection in a cluster. It is written in Python and comes up with an exemplary React-based client that visualizes the results produced by the system.

## Running the application

### Locally

First, adjust the configuration file (`kad/config.yaml`), specifying the data source fot the system and metric that will be monitored.

Then, install the requirements:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then you can start the application:

`python kad/main.py`

Alternatively, you can build a docker image using Dockerfile present in `kad/Dockerfile`

### K8s cluster

The configuration can be found in `kad/kad-configmap.yaml`.

To start the application in k8s cluster, run the following:

    kubectl apply -f kad-configmap.yaml
    kubectl apply -f kad-deployment.yaml
    kubectl apply -f kad-service.yaml

## Architecture

KAD consists of six independent modules: Core, Data Source Module, Data Processing Module, Model, Model Selector and Visualization Module. The core module connects all the other modules and manages the application. The Data Source Module provides a general interface that is a communication channel between KAD and the observed cluster. Currently, the system supports Prometheus data format. The Data Processing Module manipulates the data format and adjusts it to the requirements of Machine Learning Models. The Model Selector is a module that chooses a model that fits training data best. The Visualization Module gives some additional features related to the system output.

There are 4 available anomaly detection models that the user may choose from:

- Sarima
- HMM
- LSTM
- Autoencoder

The model can be either chosen manually or selected in an automatic procedure.

KAD provides HTTP API that allows to fetch data from the application and modify its configuration. It exposes configurable endpoints for both results fetching and configuration updates.

## Exemplary client

KAD comes with an exemplary client application that uses the KAD HTTP API to communicate with the system and graphically visualize its behaviour. The client is written using React framework and allows manipulating KAD config and displaying the analysed time series.
